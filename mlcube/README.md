# mlcube
This directory is a template for creating MLCube directories that GaNDLF can deploy.

The workspace contains a sample "channelIDs.yml" that can be passed to the construct_csv task and a "config.yml" example used for training/inference.
However, generally, the workspace will be populated with a user's own files.
