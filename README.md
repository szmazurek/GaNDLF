The **G**ener**a**lly **N**uanced **D**eep **L**earning **F**ramework for segmentation, regression and classification.

## Why use this?

- Supports multiple
  - Deep Learning model architectures
  - Data dimensions (2D/3D)
  - Channels/images/sequences 
  - Prediction classes
  - Domain modalities (i.e., Radiology Scans and Digitized Histopathology Tissue Sections)
- Robust data augmentation, courtesy of [TorchIO](https://github.com/fepegar/torchio/)  
- Built-in nested cross validation (and related combined statistics), with support for parallel HPC-based computing
- Handles imbalanced classes (e.g., very small tumor in large organ)
- Multi-GPU (on the same machine - distributed) training
- Leverages robust open source software
- No need to write any code to generate robust models
- [Automatic mixed precision](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) support
